        <h1>Imagine Dragons-Bones</h1>
        <a href="index.html">Go Back</a>
        <p>
            “Bones” dives into some morbid topics. The singer talks about the feeling of aimlessness and purposelessness of life in the grand scheme of things. Life is such a fragile thing that can dwindle away any second. The lead singer of Imagine Dragons, Dan Reynolds suffered some loss in his family not too long ago, which had prompted him to a state of grief, which he had expressed in songs such as “Birds” and “Wrecked” before.The singer tries to be brave in the face of his loss. He looks at the man in the mirror and barely recognizes him. What is the purpose of all things he does, if he cannot have the things he wants in life?! The singer did not wish for immortality. He merely wished for a long and happy life for himself and the people around him. 
            In the second verse of the song, Imagine Dragons sing about the duality of life. One such concept is whether life is all black and white i.e. if ‘good and bad’ are as cut and dry as they sound. Is good for one person the same good for another person.
